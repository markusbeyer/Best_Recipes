## **How to Make Borsch**

Ukrainian borscht recipe is actually very easy to make and anyone can do it. I like my borsch with variety of vegetables, with thin flavorful broth, lots of fresh garlic and dill.

## Here is a quick rundown of how to make borscht:

1. **Prep veggies:** *You want to start with cabbage first because it takes the longest time to cook. While it is cooking, you can prep other vegetables.*
2. **Cook cabbage in broth** *with bay leaves and peppercorns for 20 minutes after bringing to a boil. Chop beets, potatoes, carrots and onion in the meanwhile.*
3. **Saute onion and carrots** *in a bit of olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. This makes onion flavorful making entire borscht recipe more delicious. Do not skip.*
4. **Then add beets** *and a bit more oil, cook for another 5 minutes.*
5. **Transfer sauteed veggies to the pot** *along with potatoes, tomato paste and salt. Cook covered for 20 minutes. In the meantime, prep garlic, dill and other seasonings.*

> **Nota bene:**
*Season borscht with white vinegar, garlic, sugar and pepper. You can also use red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar or lemon juice. Traditional choice is white vinegar though.*

### Stir, turn off heat and let borscht soup stand for 10 minutes covered to allow flavors to “marry” each other. Add dill and your borscht is ready to serve!
